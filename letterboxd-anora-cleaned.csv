the things i would do to get on this bitch finsta..the things i would give to have a drunk cig with her on myrtle broadway at 3am...i know we would have thee most life altering convo in the girls bathroom and then never speak ever again. i would die for her
a cinderella story for girls on SSRIs
probably the best theatergoing experience i‚Äôve had since parasite
Simultaneously the funniest and one of the saddest movies of the year.
"Once Igor appears on screen the movie shifts to his perspective. (Or, in a way, it clarifies the perspective it already had.) Baker expects us to be impressed that Igor views Ani as a human being. He seems to expect the same praise for himself."
Bouncing on it in a way that makes you cry at the end.
"Appreciated this in ways I didn't expect at all: ridiculously amusing humour present throughout the entire thing, while profound sadness is so close - You'll be hard pressed to find a film with a more perfectly calibrated mix of anguish and comedy than this one. Absorbs you immediately with its powerful undercurrent and infectious appeal, takes you through an almost traditionally frenzied fish out of water story (with some of the most fucking hilarious single moments of the year), then overwhelms you to the point of total and utter sorrow. Such a significant project. Mikey Madison is likewise exceptional, as you might expect."

"Anora ‚Äî or ‚ÄúAni,‚Äù as she prefers to be called ‚Äî is a brassy, 23-year-old Russian-American stripper who shares a small house with her sister in Brighton Beach. Ivan ‚Äî or ‚ÄúVanya,‚Äù as he uses interchangeably ‚Äî is the 21-year-old son of a Moscow billionaire who stays in his father‚Äôs cocaine mansion on the far side of Brooklyn whenever he‚Äôs in New York, which if it were up to him would be always. She works seven nights a week at‚Ä¶"
I love goons
Holy shit what a blast. Didn't even recognize Mikey Madison at first since she didn't get set on fire
that's future academy award winner mikey madison to you
"Mikey Madison is superb in this very unique effort from Sean Baker. PRETTY WOMAN comparisons aren't really relevant beyond some basic plot set-up, and after the stage is set, the film is utterly unpredictable, quite funny, and hides surprising depth. One of the best I've seen this year."
"great goons, beautiful goons"
may god bless the dinosaur that died to make the fossil fuel that was treated to become petrol in the car that took her mom to the hospital to give birth to her
These Russian billionaires didn‚Äôt stand a chance against the mouth on Anora.
Mikey Motherfucking Madison <3
CUNTNORAAAAA girl fuck ur franchise and ur tentpole bitch WE IN THIS SHITTTTTTTT WE SAVED CINEMA
"A great fucking time at the movies. Delightfully funny, especially when it becomes a screwball journey film through the second act. Yet another Sean Baker movie with a standout moment of characters walking against a beautiful sunset that'll stick in my mind. He's made a career out of humanizing the intersection and branches of sex work and love but this one feels like such a holistic and complete treatise on the themes that I'm so curious as to what he'll‚Ä¶"
"Anora is fun. I‚Äôll say that. After all the hype over these last few months, I will say that it‚Äôs a fun movie. Mikey Madison is fantastic playing her. However, the fun can only go so far, and there‚Äôs not a lot of movie around it. I found its structure pretty well done in its triptych-esque form, but for a film called Anora, it‚Äôs not really into developing her. It's superficially entertaining and crafts a thrill ride around several ideas‚Ä¶"
"If you don‚Äôt like this movie, you must be a very boring person. I‚Äôm sorry"
There‚Äôs a moment in here that made me feel like I could fly
"Hmmm. This one didn‚Äôt hit for me y‚Äôall. Mikey Madison has her sparks. But this film is a bit too emotionally threadbare, our lead is too improperly shaded, and it‚Äôs a touch too long. Easy to watch but light weight in a frustrating way. Certain notes don‚Äôt hit at all. Pretty but not wholly striking in its cinematography. Some humor but little heart, grit, or emotional intrigue. Sean Baker has a social curiosity into the realms of people who live‚Ä¶"

"just when i thought this could not get any better, it hits you with a ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD"
"It‚Äôs sensual, funny, devastating and profoundly sad. We see a young girl who has always lived in conformity, stuck in routine and resigned to the life she has. She accepts her reality without questioning it, until someone appears who shows an apparently so genuine and welcoming affection that it makes her disconnect from the real world. It is not only affection, but an almost miraculous sense of security. Even hesitant at first, Ani believes she has found her prince charming‚Ä¶"
"Great character, very good performance, Baker talent for madcap farce is put to great use. There are a lot of lively scenes, although it goes out of control a little too often. I don‚Äôt think this actually works. Neither of Madison relationships with the two key guys work, so the film feels hollow. The movie structure, predicted in offering Madison the world and then taking it away, need a much stronger foundation that the movie mostly fumbles. The first part‚Ä¶"
"‚Äúme go fuck myself? me fuck myself? you go fuck yourself and your fucking mother, motherfucker‚Äù"
"Everyone has had their time wasted by somebody who doesn‚Äôt truly care for them, and everyone has hopelessly clung onto that person through the inevitable implosion. Coming out the other side, it‚Äôs hard to know what to do with yourself. In the aftermath, even a truly decent person can be scary as they are alluring. Settled dust is still dust, all it takes is another storm."
catch it in a packed theater if you can
see what happens when a twink acts like he can handle a baddie
"Nope. This ain‚Äôt it, chief. My estimation of Baker‚Äôs cinema has lessened with each new film since the galvanizing call ofTangerine, and now with this, his biggest Hollywood cash-cow, Baker reaches a kind of defeatist and profoundly depressing nadir that left me disappointed, baffled, bored. THAT‚Äôs what you have to say about this baddie? That‚Äôs it? That‚Äôs the best you can come up with? Who is this devastation for? Is it for Cannes approval? Baker in Hollywood continues his¬†leering‚Ä¶"
"Blinds you with its glittery lights and thrumming bass and disarming humor until you‚Äôre left on your knees sobbing. Can‚Äôt begin to fully articulate how immensely heavyAnorawinds up feeling by its conclusion. Sean Baker is always able to tie the humor together with heartbreak, but I think this film is where that blend is especially concentrated and effective."
"Okay, so. Where to start?"
Surely one of the great deliveries of the word ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù in film history.
just as good the 2nd time. noticed the Strawberry billboard in Vegas and thought that was just great
I have never experienced a theatre audience so loud throughout a film and so deafeningly silent as the credits rolled.
"Two movies in one, one with immediate satisfaction that softens in memory the other that lodges itself into the more conflicted parts of your brain. So much to enjoy and unpack long after it‚Äôs over. I do wish she‚Äôd gotten the Cinderella suite though. Mikey Madison must be the biggest star in the world."
"a ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù driven by a bunch of shallow stereotypes and Yuriy Borisov‚Äôs charisma, with male gaze fixated on Mikey Madison's nude body and the life of sex workers.Anoralacks any depth or originality, it justifies violence against women, it tries but fails to convincingly portray Anora as a strong female character. she is reduced to merely following orders and yelling, making this a deeply flawed, male-centric nightmare of a movie instead."
how soon is too soon to put this in one‚Äôs all-time top ten. asking for a friend of course not me hahaha that‚Äôd be so silly
I hate when Bakers put unnecessary sex scenes in their movies.
mildly amusing at best until it abruptly becomes a real movie in its last ten minutes. mikey madison doing really incredible work with a role that is basically nothing on paper. sean baker can do better!
"Radiantly evil. Works best when it‚Äôs a screwball comedy about a spoiled Russian teenager. I love the way he slides across the floor and runs up the stairs in his dad‚Äôs mansion. Reminds me of European international school kids. But then it becomes a repetitive cat-and-mouse chase where a lot of people talk over each other while also telegraphing the dumbest, most obvious ending imaginable. It‚Äôs the worst of Gerwig and the Safdies combined."
shout out to the old man who said to his wife ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a deeply sinful picture‚Äù as he was walking out during the credits
Wow.
"Not so much Sean Baker expanding his indie-art festival mode interest in the ground level community texture and labor of sex work and street hustling, but rather finding a way to package it into a slickly crafted populist piece of pure manic comic-thriller entertainment."
"my favorite movie of every year is the one that makes me feel like that video of keanu reeves going‚Äúi love movies. gosh, i LOVE movies.‚Äùfor the entire runtime. and while there have¬†been some pretty solid contenders for that title this year, truly none come close to the two-and-a-half-hour-long highanoragives me."
"An astonishing Mikey Madison performance in a film that frustrated me to no end. Baker‚Äôs hands off/no judgement approach always strikes me as a simple lack of curiosity and that‚Äôs at its worst here. No interiority, no idea who she is."
mikey madison could do hustlers but jennifer lopez couldn‚Äôt do anora
Anora just won the palme d‚Äôor
can‚Äôt wait to show this one to my gran (she‚Äôs a big take that fan)
did not expect a film that opens with a take that club remix needle drop to be this STRESSFUL yeah mikey madison we are getting you that oscar

"Whatever you want to call it - stylish romp, gritty fairytale, modern tragedy, Anora is undoubtably a technical feat. With a captivating lead performance by Mikey Madison, donning the thickest Coney Island accent she could conjure, and breathtaking camerawork, Sean Baker crafts an immersive, genuinely hilarious experience for us that‚Äôs impossible not to enjoy."

This is really very good and Madison is as terrific as you've heard but Sean Baker is alas not quite Billy Wilder.

"Out on digital today! Saw this again a bit ago, it was one of myfavorite videos to do this year. To say it‚Äôs one of the best of 2024 feels too small. Mikey Madison Oscar now!!!"
Mikey Madison most beautiful perfect woman ever
"ANORA is yet another chaotic, vivacious film from Sean Baker exploring the American Dream through themes of adult independence & the rewards of hard work. Stressful, loud & sweet, with plenty of laughs and a gut-punch of an ending. Mikey Madison, already a standout in supporting roles, radiates star power with her feisty fierceness and emotional vulnerability, making her an engrossing actress to watch. As significant of a film as this might be for Sean Baker, Madison‚Äôs big moment has arrived."

"f**ot ass bitch. american humanism is an excuse to leer at women crying. A character that is an allegory is a person dehumanized. extremely fun movie that made me extremely nauseous. borderline evil and I‚Äôm being generous with the borderline. last fifteen minutes reveal that Baker was deliberately doing the thing i swore he didn‚Äôt mean to do. Maybe a m*sterpiece, maybe just neolib pity slop, give me a minute."
"lmao who would've thought that a film with russian oligarchs and sex workers, that three goons would turn out to be the best part."
"If I start incessantly using the wordmotherfucker, mind your business"
who needs that twink Ivan when you could have IGORRRRR
Baker‚Äôs Grand Thesis.Not a false note in a frame.Igor is the silent assassin of scenery.The baptism call scene (‚Äú‚Ä¶nooooo!‚Äù) tore the roof off of the audience.The crowd was going wild‚Ä¶till they didn‚Äôt and it landed hard and perfect.And any film that thanks Jess Franco is tops in my book.Not going Full Five because I wanna give it more when I watch it again ASAP.Bravo Sean.
Love it so much . Anora is my shubhs
"Ok wow. Firstly mikey Madison the woman that you are. Secondly, I‚Äôm always deeply moved and forever surprised by Sean bakers immense sensitivity. This movie beautifully portrays objectification and rich frivolity without making it political or on the nose, it made me laugh it made me cringe it made me cry, I am so moved by the simplicity in the last scene. This film feels deeply real and somehow magical and as the credits rolled I just thought ‚Äúwow I love movies‚Äù"
i knew i shouldn't have trusted someone who holds a controller like that
the dream of a lifetime. PALME D‚ÄôANORA #ANORASWEEP mikey madison is the greatest actress of our generation

"the Safdies on MDMA x Tarantino without a script, little budget & cojones x a splash of screwball x a dash of slapstick x a spritzer of rom-com. interesting how Baker gets 1.) increasingly funnier with every film and 2.) parallely less intrigued with his theme of sex work."
the person you end up feeling the most attracted to is not the person who you go into this movie expecting to feel the most attracted to
i need a romcom sequel with ani and igor NOW !!!
Extremely weird choice to put a film‚Äôs whole emotional core in the last 30 seconds or so. Like yeah it‚Äôs great to finally get that catharsis but it left me feeling kinda like I spent 2+ hours waiting for something that ended soon as it began.
in 2018 I used to smoke weed exactly the same the way vanya does until I dropped my dab pen off the brooklyn bridge and decided it was probably a sign I shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to own one of those
sean baker i‚Äôm begging you to never stop making movies
"What a whirlwind. Insanely hilarious and beautiful and sad. Mikey Madison is a star, A STAR!!"
"just like the fireworks in Vegas, it‚Äôs a projection of escape. it looks convincing, maybe it‚Äôs real enough to make you feel good under the lights when you walk by the stores, seduced by the allure of it all. but it‚Äôs not real. it‚Äôll never be real"
"Way more of a Safdie Bros pic in the second act than I was even remotely prepared for, goddamn. I came to laugh, love, and cry, not writhe uncontrollably and awkwardly chuckle out of secondhand embarrassment. Regardless, Sean Baker has once again succeeded in completely overwhelming and absorbing me into the endearing hilarity and whimsical beauty of his characters and their light-hearted world, while also making me feel absolutely appalled and disgusted both with myself and with the hopeless plight‚Ä¶"
I had no idea where this was going and I loved that ride.
Never get on the plane!
"for about 45 minutes i thought i might finally enjoy a sean baker movie. for the next five hours i thought, no, i‚Äôm definitely watching a sean baker movie."
it‚Äôs not anora. it‚Äôs ani.
igor looks so much like trixie mattel out of drag and yet i want him so bad

"Anorais strongest in its first act, a shimmering fantasy whirlwind undergirded by a deeply humanist lens, every second of genuine laughter accompanied by a fleeting sense of uncertainty, realism, even foreboding - in other words, a Sean Baker film in the best way. Some might decry the length of time spent on setting up the initial romance, but I think it's refreshing when a film understands that you have to set up before you can break down. Plus, it‚Ä¶"
give mikey madison the oscar right fucking now
"I've always respected Baker's naysayers even if I could never really agree with where they were coming from vis-√†-vis his supposed social tourism and self-defeating apoliticism. But despite the across-the-board strong performances here,Anorais where he hit a wall for me. Among other things, Baker's nonjudgmental approach to the recurring topic of sex work has yielded fewer and fewer insights from his high-water mark ofTangerine, not coincidentally the film where he solicited the most collaborative input from his‚Ä¶"
Can‚Äôt believe it took me this long to watch this‚Ä¶.. everyone is a star & Sean Baker you can do whatever you want for the rest of your life!!!!! Ivy has the funniest line in the movie I hope Obama giggled at it when he watched this
"my beloved and oh so talented, Mikey Madison¬†ü©∑"
GOD BLESS AMERICA
WE ARE SO FUCKING BACK !!!
"Film named Anora, but I don‚Äôt know anything about her, or her intentions. I wish women were written better and taken seriously."
These movies used to be a tight 90
"Let's get it out of the way, I'm no fun!! First thing's first. Igor innocent. I would crumble if a hot bald guy did the double cigarette light. Don't read beyond here if you don't want spoilers!"
"It gets much better on the second viewing. Seeing this long after Cannes with the best audiences possible. Everybody gets it. I could focus on a lot of details now. The editing was the smartest thing done, Sean Baker knew what he wanted. It‚Äôs probably the most fun I‚Äôve had this year with a film, not a typical comedy and it doesn‚Äôt beg anyone to like it for anything. It‚Äôs so full of life and it‚Äôs so Sean Baker, you‚Ä¶"
who is this DIVA?
mikey madison.
"Anorais a full Mikey Madison spectacle. She transforms this quick-witted and genuinely funny film into something that ultimately transcends its comedic roots, blossoming into something much deeper and more impactful. Together, she and Sean Baker craft a narrative that seamlessly weaves humor with increasingly somber and thought-provoking reflections, as Ani gradually begins to grasp the heartbreaking reality that her best chance at a better life is slowly disintegrating before her eyes. The film operates like a precision scalpel, cutting‚Ä¶"
"If PRETTY WOMAN is sunrise, and LEAVING LAS VEGAS is sunset, then this is magic hour."
I keep thinking about this one.
"A hist√≥ria da protagonista de Anora, que se apresenta como Ani (Mikey Madison), come√ßa a se movimentar quando surge em cena Ivan (Mark Eidelstein), um jovem herdeiro russo com dinheiro demais e limites de menos, que se torna cliente dela no clube em que Ani trabalha. Inexperiente e alienado em seu universo de luxo e ostenta√ß√£o, Ivan se encanta por Ani (bem, no m√≠nimo, pelos servi√ßos sexuais que ela lhe proporciona) e, em uma escalada ca√≥tica, os dois acabam se‚Ä¶"
the feminine urge to frustrate a man
makes sense that Sean Baker‚Äôs big break into the mainstream (complete with slapstick gags and big pop music montages) is still an ultimately bleak fable about sexual/financial/mental exploitation and the false promise of escape inside capital. Red Rocket is (at this point) my preferred Baker but the way this translates his ideas/aesthetics to a more palatable (relative) serving without giving into the satisfying and cheap releases that typically come with the territory (in ways that serve to the inherent desire‚Ä¶
